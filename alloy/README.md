# Karat 💜 Alloy

Karat allows executing [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/) specifications from within Kotlin. The main features are:

- 🕰️ Complete coverage of Alloy's temporal formula language,
- 🧱 _Reflection_ of Kotlin classes and objects as Alloy signatures,
- 🤖 _State machine_ builder which removes the need of manual handling.

There's not much documentation, but you can look at the 
[`leader_election` example](https://github.com/47degrees/karat/blob/main/alloy/src/main/kotlin/karat/alloy/example/LeaderElection.kt),
which implements the model from [this tutorial](https://haslab.github.io/formal-software-design/protocol-design/index.html).
